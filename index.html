      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jacob. After always having an interest with computers I have decided to give Coding and Programming a crack after working in Accounting on and off for the last 5 years. COVID allowed me to rethink what it is a really want to do. So here I am!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Perth, Australia</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Love The Arsenal and F1 - Hoping for a good season from Danny Ric this year. CMON McLaren!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Wouldn't say I have a dream job. I am more interested in finding a job in an area I am interested in and finding a company with good values and morals.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Still currently live just outside the CBD in Perth, Australia.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always been a creative person at heart. I feel coding can satisfy that logical/ problem solving mind that I have while also feeding that creative side. Having always been 'somewhat' tech savvy, I have always had an interest in coding but have had no idea where to start. I am hoping this course can help kickstart this interest and help push me forward!</p>
